## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
-  View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Fluid Typography
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The _:is_ selector made writing hover states for all these properties at once much easier

```css
:is(.list_item, .accordion_button, .accordion_item p):hover {
	color: var(--almost-black);
}
```

For the arrow next to the dropdown, instead of using two different SVG's and switching between them when clicked, I used the same SVG and rotated it as needed using css.

```css
.accordion_button::after {
	content: url("./images/icon-arrow-down.svg");
	position: absolute;
	top: 50%;
	transform: translateY(-60%);
	...;
}
.accordion_button.active::after {
	transform: rotateX(0.5turn) translateY(35%);
}
```

This piece of javascript helped me figure out the dimensions of the screen and switch image sources between desktop and mobile versions.
I used aspect ratio instead of screen width because the image provided sometimes leaves too much white space if based on width (e.g on Tablets)

```js
// If screen is greater than [width]
let media = window.matchMedia("(min-width: 700px)");

let aspectRatio = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;

// Setting mobile || desktop images based on screen size
function setImgSrc(_aspectRatio, _media) {
	if (_media.matches || _aspectRatio < 0.5) {
		images.forEach((image) => {
			const newImageSrc = image.src.replace("mobile", "desktop");
			image.src = newImageSrc;
		});
	} else {
		images.forEach((image) => {
			const newImageSrc = image.src.replace("desktop", "mobile");
			image.src = newImageSrc;
		});
	}
}
```
